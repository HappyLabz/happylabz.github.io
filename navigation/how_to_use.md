    On the Home Screen, you'll encounter 'Ticker Boxes', each labeled with
    their respective stock or ETF ticker. These ‘Ticker Boxes’ display current 
    HappyLabz Technologies algorithmic indicator information and serve as hyperlinks that
    redirect you to sub-pages packed with additional information about the
    particular stock or ETF.
  </p>
  <p class="textSpan">
    Currently only the TSLA 'Ticker Box' is open to the public. Happy Labz 
    Technologies partners have access to all 'Ticker Boxes.' Contact us to 
    become a partner.

<div class="sectionTitle"><h2>Boxes</h2></div>
<div class="example">
  <p class="textSpan">
    Each box displays essential information about a stock or ETF as analyzed
    by HappyLabz Technologies software.
  </p>

  <img class="SepDec" src="images/greyGreenBox.png" alt="boxGrid" />
  <ul class="descriptList">
    <li>Title: Name of Stock or ETF.</li>
    <li>
      LAST: Signifies the date and direction of the most recent algorithmic
      indicator. The color of the text aligns with the direction.
    </li>
    <li>
      DELTA: This represents the total amount of price movement in the stock
      since the last algorithmic indicator, along with the percentage change
      between that date and the current closing price.
    </li>
    <br />
    <p>
      When the colors of the LAST and DELTA text match, it implies that the
      algorithm and subsequent price movement are in agreement.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p class="textSpan">
    The Ticker Boxes are typically GRAY, a color that signifies the absence
    of a current daily indicator and that the LAST algorithm is in active
    operation. When the HappyLabz software algorithm anticipates an upcoming trend
    shift, it interacts with the website, triggering a color transformation
    in the corresponding Ticker Box. The Ticker Box turns GREEN or RED,
    symbolizing the direction that the algorithm signals the stock or ETF is
    most likely to move.
  </p>

  <img class="SepDec" src="images/boxRedFeb.png" alt="boxGrid" />

  <p class="textSpan">
    The LAST and DELTA data points are refreshed two hours after each
    trading day's closing. A Ticker Box retains its GREEN or RED for 24
    hours following an algorithmic prediction, after which it reverts to
    GRAY. Despite the color change, the DELTA continues to be updated
    daily.
  </p>

  <p class="textSpan">
    HappyLabz also offers insights into the correlation with historical 
    pivot indicators on the Hub. The YELLOW lines may be seen both above 
    and below the ticker name in a Ticker Box are called Price Lines. 
    These lines illustrate previous price points at which HappyLabz's 
    indicators were triggered. Such information can act as a vital tool 
    for making informed trading decisions.
  </p>

  <p class="textSpan">
    A Ticker Box may display a Price Line either above or below the 
    ticker name. If the Price Line is positioned above the ticker name, 
    it means that the stock's  most recent close price is BELOW, yet 
    within 1% of, a preceding pivot price. Conversely, a Price Line 
    beneath the ticker name signifies that the stock's most recent close 
    price is ABOVE and within 1% of a past pivot price.
  </p>
  <img class="imgSpanSmol" src="images/doublePriceline.png" alt="boxGrid" />
  <p class="textSpan">
    A Ticker Box might include both an Upper and a Lower Price Line. This 
    suggests that over the past year, HappyLabz has recorded a pivot point 
    at both above and below the stock's most recent close price.
  </p>
  <p>
    Price Lines are a conventional element of technical analysis and can 
    aid traders in identifying pivot points and resistance levels in the 
    stock's movement. To facilitate ease of use, the platform provides 
    pertinent information regarding past pivot points.
